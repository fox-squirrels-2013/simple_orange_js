## Learning Objectives
1. Use Testing to TDD JavaScript code 
1. Understand basic JavaScript - functions, control structures, scope.

## Summary
Revisit the [Orange Trees]() challenge in JavaScript. Since you already know how to solve this, focus on using TDD and finding a more eloquent solution while implementing it in JavaScript. 
* Open the `orange.html` file in chrome and the console to see your first failing test.  
* Write all your tests in the `orange_spec file` and all your solution code in the `orange.js` code.
* If you like you can make a visual assert function to show your failing tests in the html (see below).

## Releases 
### Release 1
* A basic orange tree with age,  grow oranges and pick oranges.  Don't worry about implementing a basket. 

### Release 2
* Add a basket and computing the average diameter of an orange
